### What I learned

I learned about Multi-column responsive layout.

```html
<div class="row sec-row">____</div>
```
```css
.sec-row {
column-gap: 2.5rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I will keep on practicing various layout challenges, and use these multi-column attributes in them wherever columns are used.  

### Useful resources

- [w3schools-multiple-columns](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_multiple_columns.asp) - This helped me understand multi-column responsive layout. I really liked this site and will use it going forward.
